<h3><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h3>
<p><strong><a name="history"></a>History and Motivation for COMMENCE?<br>
  </strong>In 2003 I was the Technical Chair of WDIC2003 and needed software to 
run the event. I looked at Cyberchair and START V1 and eventually settled on 
START to run the event.&nbsp; Start was legacy code because Start2.0 is now 
commercial, so there were lots of issues in getting it to run successfully.&nbsp; 
In our School we are not allowed to manage our own public webservers because of 
all the security holes it may open up, so I had to run on the corporate 
webserver.&nbsp; For security reasons I was not allowed to have an account on 
the corporate webserver, nor were applications allowed to write on the file 
system.&nbsp; This meant that installing START was a nightmare and involved many 
hours talking to the system administrator.&nbsp; I felt uncomfortable that my 
every request to access papers etc would have to be mediated by the system 
administration but had no choice in the matter. In any case he assured me that 
he had no life and would be at my beck and call.&nbsp; Of course, when the 
conference notification of acceptance came up, he was nowhere to be found and I 
had no way of accessing the information.&nbsp; I eventually managed to access 
the system by logging in as every one of the 40 users and extracting the 
required information.&nbsp; I never want to go through this nightmare again so I 
started the Commence project with the assistance of many students listed above.</p>
<p>Commence was designed to be very easy to install (typically less than 5 
minutes), require no administrator assistance to install or run, and operate in 
a distributed fashion on the web.&nbsp; It relies on widely used web 
technologies that are stable and well supported including php, mysql, and 
apache. Commence does not require file system access on the webserver as all the 
information is written to a mysql database over the network.&nbsp; Once 
installed, all conference management can be performed from anywhere in the world 
using a browser on the internet. Indeed, I have quite often managed my 
conferences from the comfort of my laptop over the wireless LAN in Singapore 
Changi airport. </p>
<p>The code is free to the scientific community and I intend it to stay that way 
for the foreseeable future. All I ask is that users drop me an email to let me 
know that they are using the code.</p>
<p><strong><a></a><a name="intro1"></a>What is the COMMENCE System?<br>
  </strong>The COMMENCE System is a web application, written in PHP, used for 
managing Technical 
  Conferences. It provides electronic submission of Papers or other documents, 
reviewer assignment, peer reviewing, emailing of letters of acceptance and 
rejection, and organisation of the proceedings in a form suitable for web, CDROM, 
or print publication.&nbsp; Many of the features are based on Rich Gerber's 
excellent START Submission Tracking and Review Toolbox.</p>
<p><strong><a name="intro2"></a>What does it do?</strong><br>
  COMMENCE System helps the conference chair by performing the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Collection of expressions of interest and contact details</li>
  <li>Electronic submission of papers and author details</li>
  <li>Electronic bidding by reviewers for papers</li>
  <li>Assignment of Papers to reviewers</li>
  <li>Collection of reviewer comments and recommendations</li>
  <li>Emailing letters of acceptance and rejection</li>
  <li>Allowing authors to submit revised papers after reading reviewers comments</li>
  <li>Extracting the final papers to the web, CD-ROM, or print publication</li>
  <li>Printing name tags for participating members</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a name="intro3"></a>What is Conference Info?</strong><br>
  Conference Info is  information relating to the conference that 
can be set from the administrator interface. It comprises:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Conference Name &#8211; The name of the conference (e.g., Workshop on 
  Digital Image Computing 2003)</li>
  <li>Conference Code Name &#8211; The abbreviation for the conference (e.g., WDIC2003)</li>
  <li>Conference Date &#8211; The date(s) of the conference</li>
  <li>Conference Location &#8211; The location of the conference (e.g., 
  Brisbane, Australia)</li>
  <li>Conference Hostname &#8211; The name of the sponsoring organisation (e.g., 
  Australian Pattern Recognition Society)</li>
  <li>Logo for Conference &#8211; An image file of the logo of the conference</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a name="intro4"></a>What are the Phases?</strong><br>
  Phases are different modes of operation used for running the conference. Each phase 
has 
  its own set of privileges and operations available to the users, reviewers, 
and administrators. The available phases are</p>
<ul>
  <li> Paper Submission</li>
  <li>Reviewer Bidding</li>
  <li>Reviewing</li>
  <li>Final Paper Submission 
    <p><strong>Paper Submission</strong> &#8211; allows the registered users to 
      submit their paper proposals. The users are able to submit and and edit 
    their papers 
    during this phase.</p>
    <p><em>Behaviour of Paper Submission Phase</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The user may submit a new paper or edit a submitted paper</li>
      <li>The user may withdraw papers</li>
      <li>The reviewer accounts are not active in 
        this phase although they can be set up</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Reviewer Bidding</strong> &#8211; allows the reviewer to indicate (bid 
    on) which papers they wish to review or not to review. The administrator&nbsp; 
    or chair can skip this 
      phase if he wishes to assign papers directly.</p>
    <p><em>Behaviour of Reviewer Bidding Phase</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The user is prevented from submitting  and editing    papers</li>
      <li>The reviewer indicates preferences on    submitted papers</li>
      <li>The administrator checks the reviewer preferences and assigns 
         
        papers to the most appropriate reviewers</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Reviewing</strong> &#8211; allows the reviewers to make 
      reviews on papers assigned to them.</p>
    <p><em>Behaviour of Reviewing Phase</em> </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The user is prevented from submitting new papers and editing  submitted 
        papers</li>
      <li>The user can see how many reviews have come in but cannot see any 
      decision on their papers</li>
      <li>The reviewer makes their reviews on the papers assigned to him</li>
      <li> The administrator  view the reviews  and decide 
        to accept or reject the paper.&nbsp; After the paper is accepted or rejected, 
         
        emails are be sent to inform authors of the decision.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Final Paper Submission</strong> &#8211; allows the users to submit 
    their final accepted papers for the conference. </p>
    <p><em>Behaviour of Final Paper Submission</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li> The users can see reviewer comments and the final decision on their 
      papers.</li>
      <li> The users may submit a revised copy of their accepted papers for presentation 
      at the 
        conference and correct details such as paper title and author precedence</li>
      <li> The reviewer accounts are inactive</li>
      <li> The administrator can extract all the revised papers and publish them 
      to the web, CDROM, or print.&nbsp; They can also print name tags for all 
      the participants.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><a name="SettingUp"></a>Setting up </h3>
<p><strong><a name="set1"></a>System Requirements</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Web browser (most version 4.0 and above browsers supported)</li>
  <li>Web Server with PHP 4 or 5.0 ( only tested on Apache so far)</li>

<p><strong><a name="set2" id="set2"></a>Installation<br>
  </strong>Extract the zip file into a folder (directory) in your user account 
which is publicly accessible on the web and also php-enabled.</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Step 1</strong> - From your web browser run <em>install.php</em> file, which you will 
  find in the <em>install</em> folder. For example, use a URL of the form
  <a href="http://www.myserver.uq.edu.au/~username/Commence/install/install.php">
  www.myserver.uq.edu.au/~username/Commence/install/install.php</a>.&nbsp; Fill 
  in the necessary information such as Database hostname, Database server, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Step 2</strong> &#8211; After setting up the database, you will 
    be asked to fill in information about the conference such as the Conference 
  Name, 
    location, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Step 3</strong> &#8211; Fill in the Start Date and End Date of 
  each phase.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Using"></a>Using the COMMENCE System</h3>
<p>The same login page is used for all functions.&nbsp; It is accessed from your 
web browser at a URL of the form
<a href="http://www.myserver.uq.edu.au/~username/Commence/install/install.php">
www.myserver.uq.edu.au/~username/Commence</a>.&nbsp; After successful login, 
people will be directed to different pages depending on the privileges of their user name.</p>
<p><strong><a name="using1"></a>What are the available privileges?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li> User</li>
  <li> Reviewer</li>
  <li> Administrator</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>User</strong> &#8211; Users are generally the authors who will submit  papers 
  to the conference.&nbsp; The user needs to register with the system to create a login 
  account. The password is emailed to the email address supplied.&nbsp; After 
receiving a password, they can login to the system and submit papers.</p>
<p><strong>Reviewer</strong> &#8211; Reviewer accounts are created by the administrator 
(chair). 
  Once the accounts are created, an email containing the reviewer login name and password 
  will be sent to each reviewer. Then, the reviewer is ready to start bidding or reviewing 
  the papers when the respective phase is enabled.</p>
<p><strong>Administrator</strong> &#8211; The Administrator or conference chair is the manager of 
the COMMENCE system.<br>
  He is responsible for:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Changing the phases manually in accordance with the proposed phase dates</li>
  <li>Setting up reviewer accounts</li>
  <li>Assigning papers to appropriate reviewers according to their preferences</li>
  <li>Accepting and Rejecting papers</li>
  <li>Sending formatted and bulk emails to users to keep participants informed 
  on the conference status</li>
</ul>
