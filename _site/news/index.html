<h2>Take Part in the Second Language Technology Programming Competition</h2> 
<span class="newsdate">[1st July 2011]</span> 

<p>
The Australasian Language Technology Association is organising a
programming competition for university undergraduate and Masters
students. 
</p>
<p>
Following on the success of last year's competition, the Language
Technology Programming Competition is formatted as a "shared task":
all participants compete to salve the same problem. The problem
highlights an active area of research and programming in the area of
language technology. You can easily obtain reasonable results with
little effort yet nobody has managed to obtain 100% correct results so
far.
</p>
<p>
The winner to the competition will be invited to the workshop of the
Australasian Language Technology Association (ALTA 2011) at Canberra
on 1-2 December.
</p>
<p>
The key dates are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Right Now  - Registration and release of training and development
data</li>
  <li>4 Oct 2011 - Release of test data</li>
  <li>7 Oct 2011 - Deadline of submission of results</li>
 <li>12 Oct 2011 - Notification of results</li>
 <li>28 Oct 2011 - Deadline of submission of system description poster</li>
<li>1-2 Dec 2011 - ALTA workshop at Canberra</li>
</ul>
<p>
Details of the task and registration are available at (<a

<h2>ALTA 2010 A Great Success</h2> 
<span class="newsdate">[7th February 2011]</span> 

<p>
ALTA 2010 is now (well and truly) over and was a roaring success! We had more
than 60 people register for the workshop, and all sessions were very well
attended.  Two successful new activities at ALTA 2010 were the shared
programming task, and the industry workshop. Based on the very positive
feedback, we hope to build upon these activities at future ALTA events.
</p>

<p>
Two papers were jointly awarded the best paper award:
</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="http://www.aclweb.org/anthology-new/U/U10/U10-1004.pdf">Variability and Consistency in the Idiosyncratic Selection of
Fillers in Japanese Monologues: Gender Differences</a> by Shunichi Ishihara;
and</li>
 <li><a href="http://www.aclweb.org/anthology-new/U/U10/U10-1013.pdf">Speaker-Dependent Variation in Content Selection for Referring Expression Generation</a> by Jette Viethen and Robert Dale</li>
</ul>
<p>
Congratulations to Shunichi, Jette and Robert.
</p>
<p>
Attendees had lots of feedback and suggested some great ideas for the ALTA Exec
to follow-up on in 2011. If you have any suggestions or feedback on what ALTA
can do to advance language technology in Australasia, don't hesitate to email
Andrew Lampert (<a href="mailto:secretary@alta.asn.au">secretary@alta.asn.au</a>).

<h2>Support ALTA to regain its ERA Conference ranking</h2>
<span class="newsdate">[25th August 2010]</span> 

<p>
You may be aware that, in a last minute decision at the beginning of 2010
the ARC decided to drop all conferences with FOR code 0807 from the ERA
rankings. Our understanding is that this was a request from ALIA (Australia
Library and Information Association), on the grounds that library
researchers do not use conferences as their research input. This was
unfortunate for ALTA, ADCS and other conferences who happened to fall under
the 0807 code but which are not primarily attended by librarians. We (ALTA
and ADCS) have informally asked people who were involved in the ERA rankings
to consider restoring the two conferences to their original B ranking. We
have received no positive response other than the name of a contact person,
Andrew Calder, to whom we could approach. We are going to send <a
href="/downloads/ERALetter.txt">this letter</a> and <b>we urge all ALTA members
to post the same letter or one with similar contents</b>. We think that it will
be most effective if the letters are posted on paper, rather than
electronically.
</p>
<p>
Feel free to adapt the text to your particular case, but by all means please
post a request to restore the ERA level B to ALTA. If you do send a letter,
tell me by email so that I can keep track of petitioners.

<h2><a name="OzCLO2010"></a>OzCLO 2010 Report</h2>

<p><span class="newsdate">[15 April 2010]</span></p>

<p>On 21 March, the National Round of OZCLO was held simultaneously in
Adelaide, Armidale, Brisbane, Canberra, Melbourne, Perth  and Sydney.
In the National Round, the winning teams from each State Round
competed to solve problems on Etruscan dice, Quechua counting systems,
possession in a language of Vanuatu, and other problems. Competitors
ranged from year 9 to year 12, and came from both state and private

<p><span class="newsdate">[18 August 2008]</span>

The National Round of the Inaugural Computational and Linguistics
Olympiad (OzCLO) was held at the Universities of Melbourne and Sydney
on Wednesday 6th August.  The winning teams from the State rounds in
both states competed to solve problems in Icelandic agreement, finite
state automata, Mayan hieroglyphs, Manam Pile directionals, and
spectrograms of English.
Competitors ranged from year 10 to year 12, and came from both state
and private schools.</p>

<p>
Thanks to HCSNet we were able to run this event at all. Thanks to ALS
we had food and drinks for the competitors. Thanks to Appen, the
Macquarie Dictionary and Franklin Electronic Publishers we have as
prizes books and hand-held electronic Macquarie Schools Dictionaries
(which include material from the Macquarie Dictionary of Aboriginal
languages)</p>

<p>The results are now available on the <a href="http://www.ozclo.org.au/">OzCLO website</a> </p>

<p>It was such fun, and the students seemed so pleased and excited by
problem solving, that we plan to run the Olympiad again next year.
We'd like to hold the event earlier than June/August, and this time to
make it truly nation-wide, covering all states.  But this requires a
lot of lead time - letting the schools know, getting them to do
training sessions, and so on.  We plan to put out soon a call for
expressions of interest in being involved in the 2009 Computational
and Linguistics Olympiad.  In the meantime feel free to join the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/ozclo">OzCLO

<p><span class="newsdate">[Sydney Morning Herald, 3 August 2004]</span>

University of Wollongong accountancy lecturer George Mickhail is now
available to students anytime and anywhere--as a Web-based version of
himself driven by artificial intelligence. Virtual George, as the
program is called, started life in 2003 as a text interface, but has
evolved into a program that can carry on conversations with users by
employing a database of linguistic terms. Its behavior and interaction
with students was refined through the study of real chat sessions and
their outcomes, and the real George Mickhail says the program is so
successful that students thank him for assisting them even though it
was Virtual George who actually helped them.</p>

University of New South Wales researchers Dr. Mohammed Waleed Kadous and

assistant (PDA) that features virtual agents--a male agent named Joshua
and a female agent named Amanda--that can schedule appointments, check
the weather, read email, and perform other functions via natural
language technology called Internet conversation agent (inCA). The voice
of the PDA agents can be switched from a robotic monotone to an
Australian accent.
